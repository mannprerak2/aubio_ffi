# aubio_ffi

A new Flutter FFI plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[FFI plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/c-interop),
a specialized package that includes native code directly invoked with Dart FFI.

## Project structure

This template uses the following structure:

* `src`: Contains the native source code, and a CmakeFile.txt file for building
  that source code into a dynamic library.

* `lib`: Contains the Dart code that defines the API of the plugin, and which
  calls into the native code using `dart:ffi`.

* platform folders (`android`, `ios`, `windows`, etc.): Contains the build files
  for building and bundling the native code library with the platform application.
